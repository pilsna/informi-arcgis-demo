Just open `client/index.html` in your browser. However, if that browser is Chrome, then you need to use a small webserver, because file: urls is not accepted for JS module loading.

Server setup:

1. Install [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/download/)
2. Run the following in your terminal in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

Run server:

```bash
npm start
```
